## requirements

Currently relies on `curl` being installed, as I cannot make `sttp` to properly handle the cookies, yet.

## building

Builds with [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) against Scala 3. See options: `sbt 'core/run --help'`. E.g.

    sbt 'core/run --expo-id 835089 --weave-id 835129'
    sbt ui/run

Or build an assembled jar:

    sbt ui/assembly
    java -jar ui/ReExpo.jar

## notes

- [rcedit](https://github.com/grrrr/rcedit) - Python software written by Thomas Grill that has figured out a
  substantial part of the RC's REST interface; [exposition](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1283942/1340975)
  made with the _rcedit_.
- [MetaExpo](https://github.com/Sciss/almat-MetaExpo) - ELM/Haskell software written by Luc DÃ¶bereiner that collected
  rendered RC pages into a database, providing a new dynamic querying interface;
  [viewer interface](https://metaexpo.almat.iem.at)
