# Notes 24-Feb-2023

Next step is serialization, with a view towards creating 'diff' perspectives.

Json is probably straight forward with respect to handling 'schema evolution'.
As a text based format, we could also use it within a git versioned directory.

We only ever need to hold two snapshots in memory, so it's not important to maximally compress the
serialised data.

It will be good to either automatically create formats (as long as there is a hook to provide
evolution) or make it very, very concise.

Did we use Json serialization before? Yes. Where and using what libraries?

- _ScalaFreesound_ uses _json4s_, but not in serialisation
- _scaladon_ uses _play-json_; will that be supported in the future? After fuck-up with Akka, 
  perhaps not a good idea to rely on any company product
- _json4s_ has some 'merging' and 'diffing' mechanisms. They might come handy?

Serialization options for json4s seem good. Let's go with this.

## Snapshot

What is in a snapshot? All weaves of an exposition? Or single weaves? It's probably useful to be able to
make snapshots per weave, and not necessarily track every weave of an exposition. That doesn't preclude that
we show a diff including multiple weaves.

We store a tuple (crawl-date -> weaveData).
