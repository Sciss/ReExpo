How to store redundant information? Say I create a new snapshot, but five out of six weaves are identical to the last stored snapshot.

We could indicate identical weaves, or even identical tools. A weave is essentially a `Seq[Tool]`, so we could just
store something like a `Seq[Either[Long, Tool]]` where `Long` is the time stamp of the most recent snapshot where this tool was updated.
